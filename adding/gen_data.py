'''
Recurrent network example.  Trains a bidirectional vanilla RNN to output the
sum of two numbers in a sequence of random numbers sampled uniformly from
[0, 1] based on a separate marker sequence.

    Generate a batch of sequences for the "add" task, e.g. the target for the
    following

    ``| 0.5 | 0.7 | 0.3 | 0.1 | 0.2 | ... | 0.5 | 0.9 | ... | 0.8 | 0.2 |
      |  0  |  0  |  1  |  0  |  0  |     |  0  |  1  |     |  0  |  0  |``

    would be 0.3 + .9 = 1.2.  This task was proposed in [1]_ and explored in
    e.g. [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_length : int
        Minimum sequence length.
    max_length : int
        Maximum sequence length.
    n_batch : int
        Number of samples in the batch.

    Returns
    -------
    X : np.ndarray
        Input to the network, of shape (n_batch, max_length, 2), where the last
        dimension corresponds to the two sequences shown above.
    y : np.ndarray
        Correct output for each sample, shape (n_batch,).
    mask : np.ndarray
        A binary matrix of shape (n_batch, max_length) where ``mask[i, j] = 1``
        when ``j <= (length of sequence i)`` and ``mask[i, j] = 0`` when ``j >
        (length of sequence i)``.
